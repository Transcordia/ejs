  <h1>Enterprise JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      The JavaScript language is one of the <a href="http://adambard.com/blog/top-github-languages-for-2013-so-far/">fastest growing</a> programming languages in recent years. It's real power comes to light when it is used on the server-side as part of a next generation web stack. On this site, we will dispell some myths about the readiness of JavaScript as part of a full-stack enterprise solution.

    <h2>Replication Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      We will explore an open source system architecture that is built upon common enterprise technologies, programmed using JavaScript, and produces a standard deployment unit that will run on any Java application server. This web application will run perfectly fine as a single node on a developer's laptop or it will linearly scale across hundreds of nodes on standard PaaS cloud platforms without any change in code.
